Welcome to PixieDust
================================

`PixieDust <https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/pixiedust>`_ is an open source Python helper library that works as an add-on to Jupyter notebooks to improve the user experience of working with data. It also fills a gap for users who have no access to configuration files when a notebook is hosted on the cloud.

For more details on all that PixieDust offers to users and developers, see PixieDust's `README on GitHub <https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/pixiedust/blob/master/README.md>`_. For news, events, and other general resources, see http://ibm.biz/wdp-pixiedust.

There are two ways to dive into PixieDust:


.. raw:: html

    <div class='main-panel'>
    <h2><a href="use.html">Use</a></h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Start by trying PixieDust online in a Python notebook. Or, install and work locally if you prefer. <br></p>
    <a class='default-link' href='javascript:void(0)' onclick='window.location = "use.html"'>
    </a>
    
    </div>

    <div class='main-panel'>
    <h2><a href="develop.html">Develop</a></h2>
    <p>Create your own visualizations or apps using the pixiedust extensibility APIs. If you know HTML and CSS, you can write and deliver amazing graphics and make them available to notebook users. </p>
    <a href='javascript:void(0)' onclick='window.location = "develop.html"'>
        <span class='default-link'></span>
    </a>
   
    </div>
